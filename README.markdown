#Integration of Java + memcached + nginx

Serving full cached responses from [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org) on [nginx](http://nginx.org) with [memcached module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcachedModule).

The application used here was written by [@wbotelhos](http://github.com/wbotelhos) using [VRaptor](http://vraptor.org). You can see more about VRaptor and how he wrote the application on [his blog](http://www.wbotelhos.com/2010/11/24/getting-started-with-vraptor-3/).

The memcached integration explanation can be checked out on this blog post: <http://www.franciscosouza.com/2010/12/killer-java-applications-server-with-nginx-and-memcached/>.
